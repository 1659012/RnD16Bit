TWO WAYS TO TAKE THIS COURSE!

1. Setup dependencies/Virtual Machines on your own, guided by the lectures

or

2. Simply import a preconfigured Virtual Machine with all the correct dependencies
and pre-written dronekit scripts. 

------------------------------------------------
1. PROS: 
		*Gain experience in setting up your own environments and
		resolving your own dependency issues that will come up 
	CONS:
		*Can be time consuming/headache inducing to solve dependency issues 
		
2. PROS: 
		*Don't have to deal with dependency installations
    CONS:
		*More likely to cheat yourself and not write your own scripts.
		Writing your own scripts is how you get muscle memory and 
		actually learn!
		
1.5 (Mixture of 1 and 2: RECOMMENDED!)
	PROS: 
		*Access to environment that is confirmed to work to help you
		rule out human error in debugging. 
		*If running into dependency issues, hop on the pre-configured
		environment and investigate/note any dependency differences.
