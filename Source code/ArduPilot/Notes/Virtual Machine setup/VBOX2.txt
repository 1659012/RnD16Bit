
Setup our Ubuntu virtual machine in VirtualBox
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
MAKING NEW VM IN VBOX:
1. New
2. Name it/Type (Linux) Version (Ubuntu 64 bit)
3. RAM/Memory size. Depends on computer. ~2 gb should work
4. Choose harddrive (Create a virtual hard drive now)
5. Hard drive file type (VDI)
6. Storage on physical hard drive (Dynamically Allocated)
7. VM hardrive disk space ~30-50 gb should be lower safe amount. 

THIS CREATES A NEW MACHINE IN THE VBOX LIST, but need to install the ubuntu 
.iso image to this machine in VBOX

1. Click on settings of the newly created machine
2. Enable shared clipboard (CP/Paste sharing of host OS and VM OS)
3. Drag and drop (Bidirectional
4. Can alter things like amount of cores allocated to VM

POINT THE UBUNTU IMAGE (.iso file) TO THE VM
Sotrage>Controller
Click on CD symbol, choose virtual CD/DVD disc file and select the iso file 
download earlier (UBUNTU Xenail Xerus)
Click OK
Start VM and the installation process will start

Finally, your virtual machine will typically reserve all the RAM you give it,
 whenever it is running.
 When the virtual machine is turned off, suspended, hibernated, or otherwise not running,
 this RAM will not be in use. 
 For example, I have about 10 virtual machines, most of which have 1 GB of RAM,
 on a host machine with 4 GB of RAM.
 This is not a problem; it just means I can only run up to a few of them at a time.

Donâ€™t allocate too much RAM to your VM, because windows still needs some RAM to operate.
 Try starting out with 2 gb or 45% of your computers RAM
