Launch first simulated drone using sim_vehicle.py
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


What does sim_vehicle.py do?
Launches our simulated drone with four main steps:
1. Detects what vehicle to build for (Copter, Plane, Rover etc)
2. Compiles the necessary source code into an executable
3. Launches the simulated drone by running the SITL executable
4. Launches MAVProxy to communicate with/command the SITL drone

Where is it located?
ardupilot/Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py
