Make the functions to move the drone with velocity commands,
with two different functions: One for local and the other for
global NED velocity
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



Key thing to note:
	
	Velocity commands must be resent every 1 second to keep 
	the drone in constant motion. Sending 1 velocity
	message will only move the drone for 1 second.
