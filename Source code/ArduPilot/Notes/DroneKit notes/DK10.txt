Create a function to control/position the yaw
of the drone.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Kep points: 

	Similar to how we have 2 frames of reference
	to use when controlling the drone with velocity
	commands, we also have 2 ways to assign the
	yaw of the vehicle (global and relative).
