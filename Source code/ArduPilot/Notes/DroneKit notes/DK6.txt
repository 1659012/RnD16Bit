Using AUTO mode to fly our drone.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Remember the MAVLink commands we looked at earlier?
(-->> If you dont) http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-mavlink-mission-command-messages-mav_cmd.html

Most of these commands will work in BOTH the GUIDED and AUTO flight modes. 

The difference here can be boiled down to this:

	AUTO flight mode triggers pre-destined flights. The drone
	will perform all the commands in its mission list. You
	don't have to continuously monitor the drones progress
	(Like measuring when the drone has gotten close enough to
	a desired altitude. In AUTO mode, the ardupilot software
	determines this for you).

	GUIDED mode gives you more control of the drone, but places
	more monitoring responsibility on the dronekit-scripter

	AUTO mode takes away a lot of control from the dronekit script
	and performs entirely autonomous missions (The missions you
	uploaded)

GUIDED mode great for:
	Flights that will require some special functionality/circumstances that
	aren't achievable in pure ArduPilot. 
	EXAMPLE: Using OpenCV object detection in a separate python script 
	to trigger movement commands in dronekit that then get sent to ardupilot

AUTO mode great for:
	Missions that will not require dynamic/reactive attention. 
	EXAMPLE: Surveying a field and flying in predetermined flight
	path, taking pictures every X meters of movement.
