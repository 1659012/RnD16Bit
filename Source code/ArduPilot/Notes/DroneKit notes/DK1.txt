//////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Where to learn more about dronekit and attributes?
	http://python.dronekit.io/guide/vehicle_state_and_parameters.html

Key new subjects in this video:

	vehicle.mode.name ##Can set our flight mode or request from the drone
			  ##what flight mode we are in


	vehcile.armed	  ##Is the drone armed (props spinning)



*******CORE THING TO REMEMBER FROM THIS VIDEO***************
If you set an attribute/parameter to some value in your
dronekit script, YOU are responsible for stopping your
code from progressing until the change has been mode.
