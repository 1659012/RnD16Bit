Introduction to parameters with ardupilot and how they can change behavior
of our drone
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


What is a parameter?
A variable that can be set to different numbers to change some of the drone's
settings/configuration or behavior

Where can you learn more about parameters?
http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html

Where can we see the list of parameters for our SITL vehicle?
	Look for a mav.parm file in the directory that you started
	sim_vehicle.py from 

Example parameters:

	RTL_ALT (cm): The height the drone will fly to when switched into
	RTL mode.

	BATT_CAPACITY (mAh): A number that is set to the milli-amp-hours of
	the battery that is being used on the drone. This may be used in
	calculation of remaining battery life. 

	ANGLE_MAX (centi-degrees): The maximum angle the drone will be able
	to pitch/roll to.
