What is a flight mode?
A flight mode is a particular way in which the rone can be controlled.
For example:
	Stabilize flight mode: Uses exclusively RC Input from the pilot
	to control the drone

	Loiter flihgt mode: Uses GPS/Barometer and a myriad of other sensor
	inputs to automatically hold the drone at a desired place in 3D space
	without requiring input from the pilot.
